I had the opportunity to contribute to this mission by collaborating with the Authentication and User Provisioning team, where we developed essential tools that empower platform administrators to better comprehend and safeguard the usage of Palantir's products and the data within them.`,

              Defense (DoD) client administrators. This tool enables them to efficiently configure and manage the
              collection of user attributes, a crucial element in enhancing access provisioning. Working closely with DoD
              implementation teams allowed me to gain insights into unique needs and technical intricacies of users within
              the DoD, ensuring that Palantirâ€™s solution was not just useful but also aligned with the security posture.`,
              `I also took on the responsibility of envisioning and designing for a third-party application governance
              tool. This tool was developed to assist admins in gaining a deeper understanding of how their orgs leverage
              external resources. I conducted research to identify measurable metrics and designed visualizations that
              would allow admins to track and optimize app usage effectively.`,
